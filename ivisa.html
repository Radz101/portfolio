                    <h2>How do you make the boring, mundane documentation process delightful? </h2>
                    <p>Traveling is fun, getting a visa, not so much. iVisa takes the pain out of the process with an app that guides our users through their travel journey. Loaded with smart integrations such as the ability to take photos at home, schedule embassy appointments from your couch, upload covid tests on your phone and much more. iVisa is optimized to not waste your time and is able to track and procure a tourist visa to any country in the world, in as little as five minutes.</p><br>

<h3>What I've learned</h3><br>
<h5>Experiments are rewarding</h5>
<p>No idea is a bad idea until it is tested. At iVisa we ran experiments all the time.  Anything that might encourage engagement, influence conversion or promote sharing was tried for a least a week. </p><br>

<h5>Collaboration is key</h5>
<p>I had the opportunity to work closely with the Design director. Our different experiences and ideas were an advantage while solving for a travel documentation problem we were all passionate about. We were even able to huddle up and bounce ideas off each other in realtime by using Figma. Cutting hours of back and forth slack/email traffic, we could easily brainstorm, design and iterate on each others wireframes and concepts.</p><br>

<h5>Good feedback leads to good design</h5>
                    <p>Being able to talk to users via user interviews was an immense help. All our design questions were influenced directly by user needs and wants. This direct feedback on our decisions and experiments really helped us and our users.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on iVisa's rebranding and app design and UX flow.</p>
